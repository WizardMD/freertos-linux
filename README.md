## FreeRTOS on Linux for developing and testing

### About

* To run FreeRTOS application on Ubuntu/Linux
* Based on `Posix GCC Eclipse FreeRTOS Simulator` by William Davy.
* See http://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-simulator-for-Linux.html
* To support latest FreeRTOS version
* Current FreeRTOS is V8.2.3

### Environment

### How to build

Please initialize submodules for the first time, need this only once.
```
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```
This will fetch `FreeRTOS` (full) source files from the github.
Takes for a while. Please be patient.

Build with
```
$ make
```

Build for ARM (Raspberry Pi),
```
$ make arm
```


### Test programs

##### My first ApplicationTickHook sample

```
$ build/bin/linuxtest01
```
* To stop the program, press `CTRL+C`


### Informations
